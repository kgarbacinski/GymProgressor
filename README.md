# Introduction
- Gym Scheduler app for Android, API 24+.
- It's been created as my first big project in mobile programming area. 
- App uses MYSQL database to store some users' data. Connection with DB has been realised with PHP language which isn't the most effective way to establish this kind of connection. Therefore, adding DJANGO REST API in progress.
- App gives you the possibility to track and save workout, save body measurement, remeber one rep max of different exercises and estiamte you strength level.

# Tech-stack
